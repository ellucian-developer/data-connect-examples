# Data Connect Pipelines Demonstrating Create PDF Fitting

This repository provides sample pipelines that showcase how to generate PDFs using Create PDF fitting and deliver them using various destination fittings, including File Writer, SFTP PUT, Send Notification, and Create ZIP.

---
## Pipelines Included

* `send-email-notification-of-invoice-in-pdf-from-html` - This pipeline is used to read multiple files at the same time from s3 and convert them to PDF(Invoice) and send them over email
* `send-invoice-over-SFTP-server-in-pdf-from-html` - This pipeline is used to read multiple files at the same time from s3 and convert them to PDF(Invoice) and send them over SFTP server
* `zip-file-of-invoice-in-pdf-from-html` - This pipeline is used to read multiple files at the same time from s3 and convert them to PDF(Invoice) and create a zip file of all the invoice

## Prerequisites

You will need:

* Experience Premium with Integration Designer
* Banner system access
* A verified email address for sending notifications
* A SFTP Server with valid credentials
* An S3 bucket with valid credentials and all required files uploaded to the `data` folder

## Pipeline Details 

### `send-email-notification-of-invoice-in-pdf-from-html`

> **Note:** The `send-invoice-over-SFTP-server-in-pdf-from-html` and `zip-file-of-invoice-in-pdf-from-html` pipelines follow similar steps; the main difference is that the first sends the PDF files over an SFTP server, while the latter creates a ZIP archive of the PDF files.

This pipeline performs the following steps:
1. Reads all images, converts them into buffers, and adds them to the `context`
2. Read the `.css` file and add to the `context`
3. Read the `invoiceDetails.json` file process it and add to the `context`
4. Convert PDF from HTML formatter which contains `HTML` and `context` data.
5. Sends a notification email to the user.

## Execution Instructions

1. **Create and Publish the Pipeline:** 
   Use Integration Designer to create and publish the pipeline. The pipeline is pre-configured with several parameters, some of which have default values. Be sure to specify the email addresses for both the "to" and "from" fields, as well as the S3 bucket name, access key, and secret access key.
2. **Configure the Job:**  
   In Integration Packages, a new job should be created for the pipeline.  
   During job setup, values for the sender and receiver email addresses, S3 bucket name, and credentials must be provided.  
   The job should be configured to trigger on the specified event, with completion alerts set as required.

## Other Use Cases

This pipeline pattern is especially useful in higher education institutes for sending custom documents, such as:

- Transcripts
- Financial Statements
- Housing Assignments
- Invoice


## Conclusion

This example demonstrates how higher education institutes, powered by Data Connect, can custom documents over email as an attachment or ZIP file.
